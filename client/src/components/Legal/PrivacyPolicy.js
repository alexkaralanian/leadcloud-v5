            <p>
              The information we collect through our Service helps us provide
              you with information specific to your needs and interests. This
              privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) covers the LeadCloud service
              (the “Service”). Please read below to review our Privacy Policy
              and the types of information we gather through our Service. In
              this Privacy Policy, “we”, “us”, “our” and other similar
              references mean LeadCloud and “you” and “your” and other similar
              references mean a specific user of the Service. By registering for
              and using the Service, you accept the practices described in this
              Privacy Policy.

            <h3>How Does LeadCloud Gather and Use Information?</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>(i) Cookies.</strong> Cookies are pieces of data assigned
              by a web server that uniquely identify the browser on your
              computer. LeadCloud attempts to install cookies as part of the
              Service. Cookies enable our systems to recognize you and to gather
              information about your navigational patterns through the site. In
              the course of serving advertisements or optimizing the Service to
              our users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or
              recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information
              provided to third parties through cookies will not be personally
              identifiable but may provide general information for the
              enhancement of your user experience by providing more relevant
              advertising. Users have the option to accept or disable cookies at
              any time through their browsers. Visit the “help” portion of your
              toolbar for more information. If you block or refuse to accept
              cookies, or delete cookies between uses of the Service, you may
              not be able to access or use certain features or functions of our
              Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(ii) Server Statistics.</strong> We collect general
              statistics to track user trends for our Service. The information
              that is collected in this manner does not provide us with any
              personally identifiable information about our users. This allows
              us to determine the most effective ways to communicate with our
              users. In order to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers
              into the Service we may collect information, such as IP addresses,
              into a log file to be used to identify potential hackers of the
              Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(iii) Personal Information You Provide Us.</strong> For
              the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” is any
              information that identifies you, would enable someone to contact
              you, or that describes your relationship with Contactually. We
              collect and store Personal Information when you register to use
              our Service, ask a question, complete a form, conduct a
              transaction, or send us an email. If you do not provide the
              requested information, you may not be able to access or use some
              of the features and functions of our Service. We use your Personal
              Information to complete transactions, respond to your requests,
              deliver the products and services you request, and notify you of
              promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(iv) Content You Provide Us.</strong> Should you provide
              us with any Content, we will assume that you have the right to
              provide us with such information. We may use such information in
              aggregated form to provide suggested contacts or other information
              to users of the Service.

              As part of the Services, you may give us access to your CRM or
              another third party service. We will only use that access as part
              of providing the Services, and we will only provide access to that
              information to other users if you direct us using functionality
              provided as part of your account to provide those users with
              access.

            </h3>
            <p>
              We use physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to
              assist us in preventing unauthorized access, maintaining data
              accuracy, and correctly using your Personal Information and any
              Content. We use reasonable efforts to avoid the presence of
              malware on our site or as part of the Service. Except to the
              extent due to our gross negligence or willful misconduct, we
              expressly disclaim, and you release us from any liability
              associated with any technical issues caused by the Service,
              including any malware communicated to your computer or mobile
              device through any use of the Service. Except as specified in this
              Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit
              access to your Personal Information and any Content to the
              employees, agents, and officers of LeadCloud who need the
              information for their jobs.

            </h3>
            <p>
              LeadCloud may share information with carefully selected vendors
              and business partners with whom we work. This includes individuals
              and companies that perform marketing services and other business
              operations for us. All individuals and companies that act on our
              behalf are contractually obligated to keep all information
              confidential and to use your Personal Information and any Content
              only to provide the services we ask them to perform for you and
              us. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers,
              sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable
              third party vendors, but these statistics do not include Personal
              Information. We may disclose Personal Information and Content we
              collect from you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith
              belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to obey the law or comply
              with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect
              and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of
              other users of our Service; or (c) to act in an emergency to
              protect the personal safety of users of our Service or the public.

              <strong>External Links.</strong> Other companies or organizations
              may have links to their websites in our Service. We are not

              collect, use, disclose, or secure the information that you provide
              them. If you choose to access a third party website through a link
              provided as part of our Service, you do so at your own risk and

              party-provided APIs and other tools to receive information from
              accounts to which you give us access (e.g., your email account(s)
              and your CRM platform). We are not responsible for errors or other
              issues associated with the functionality of such APIs and other
              tools.
