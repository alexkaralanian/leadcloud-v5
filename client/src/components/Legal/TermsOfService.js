            <p>
              Welcome to the LeadCloud service (the “Service”). LeadCloud
              (“LeadCloud”, “we” or “us”) provides the Service to you subject to
              the following conditions. Before you may use the Service, you must
              accept all of the terms and conditions in, and linked to, this
              Terms of Service (“TOS”) and the linked Privacy Policy. We
              strongly recommend that, as you read this Terms of Service, you
              also access and read the linked information. By accessing the
              Service, you are agreeing to be bound by this TOS. If this TOS
              conflicts with any of these other documents, the TOS will control
              for the purposes of usage of the Service. You may only use certain
              portions of the Service if you are an LeadCloud employee or
              authorized user. If you do not agree to be bound by this TOS and
              the Privacy Policy, you may not use the Service in any way.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>License and Service Access.</strong> LeadCloud grants you
              a limited license to access and make to personal use of the
              Service. This license does not permit you to, and you agree that
              you will not: (i) upload to, post on, or transmit through the
              Service any information that you do not have a right to make
              available (such as the intellectual property of another party or
              information that you are not legally permitted to use); (ii)
              upload to, post on, or transmit through the Service any material
              that contains a software virus or any other computer code, file or
              program designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality
              of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications
              equipment; (iii) take any action that imposes or may impose (at
              LeadCloud’s sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately
              large load on LeadCloud’s infrastructure; (iv) enter information
              or download information from the Service through any means other
              than direct user interaction with the Service; or (v) make any use
              of data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction
              tools to submit Content to the Service. You may not bypass any
              measures used by LeadCloud to prevent or restrict access to the
              Service. Any unauthorized use of the Service by you shall
              terminate the permission or license granted to you by LeadCloud
              and will make any further use of the Service an infringement of
              LeadCloud’s intellectual property rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Your Account.</strong> In consideration of your use of the
              Service, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding
              contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under
              the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction.
              You also agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete
              information about yourself as prompted if you use the Service’s
              registration form (the “Registration Data”). If you provide any
              information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete
              (or becomes untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete), or
              LeadCloud has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information
              is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, LeadCloud has
              the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and
              all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).
              If you use the Service, you are responsible for maintaining the
              confidentiality of your account and password, and for restricting
              access to your computer. You agree to accept responsibility for
              all activities that occur under your account or password. Because
              of this, we strongly recommend that you exit from your account at
              the end of each session. You agree to notify LeadCloud immediately
              of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of
              security.
            </p>

              You agree that you will comply with all applicable state, local,
              federal and international laws when using the Services including,

              and elsewhere. LeadCloud reserves the right to refuse service,
              terminate accounts and/or reject submitted Content in its sole
              discretion.
